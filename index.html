                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"> This map is designed to assist stakeholders in identifying an appropriate location for a new healthy grocery store in Philadelphia. Potential sites must meet four key criteria: they must lie within a Philadelphia empowerment zone, must be within 2,000 feet of a subway or regional rail station, must NOT be within 1,200 feet of a farmers market or a corner store that participates in the Healthy Corner Store initiative, and must be of a contiguous size sufficient to build and operate a store. To locate areas fitting all criteria, application of buffers and spatial joins, including intersections, unions, and erases was required. Isolating each unique eligible area also required a multipart to singlepart conversion. The final map, which showcases core mapping and design skills, identifies four distinct areas where the store could be placed, with the largest located at Avenue of the Arts and Broad Street. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">The map at left shows population density by census block in northern Miami-Dade County, Florida as of the 2020 United States Census. To build this map, several GIS skills were required, including projection, field management, and calculations, along with understanding of how Census data is constructed, managed, and interpreted. The design of this map is critical to its utility; census blocks are quite small in area, so careful consideration of the scale at which it is presented was crucial, as was thoughtful selection of color gradients for readability. This map highlights areas of Miami with high and low population density by quintile and could be useful to urban planners, city government, and other policymakers and stakeholders interested in housing policy and business development in the city and county. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">The map at right shows the results of the 2020 presidential election by county in Pennsylvania. While it seems simple at first glance, building this map required multiple GIS skills. The primary tools used here were projection, joins, and field manipulation. Good command of symbology, labeling, and layout design were also needed to create an easily readable map. This map improves understanding of the election result within Pennsylvania by county and reveals differences in vote share across the Commonwealth, which is informative to regular voters as well as to those who work in politics.</p>
